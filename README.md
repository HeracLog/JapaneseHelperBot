# JapaneseHelperBot
A telegram bot that uses scraped data from japanesepod101 and sends you an image everyday
## How to use
- Run ```pip install -r req.txt```
- Run the collect script and let it scrape the image links
- Then it will download
- After that you can filter out the images if you want
- Create a telegram bot through "BotFather"
- Add the api key in the "bot.py" script
- Start the bot and yeah that's pretty much it
## Notice
I will **NOT** upload the scraped images since I do not own them, this is simply a way for you to do it yourself
